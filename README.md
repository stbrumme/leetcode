What ?
------

This repository contains my solutions to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems.
All files are code fragments. They need the Leetcode environment for proper includes / imports / namespaces / etc.

- [x] solved more **easy**   problems than 99% of Leetcode users
- [x] solved more **medium** problems than 99% of Leetcode users
- [x] solved more **hard**   problems than 97% of Leetcode users


Why ?
-----

The main purpose **wasn't** solving these problems but upgrading my Python skills from _"beginner"_ to _"intermediate"_.
There was a warm up with a few problems in C++ and then I switched to Python.
For unknown reaaons, I solved all (free) SQL problems without a few days, too.

The focus **wasn't** on writing clean / readable / compact code but on experimenting with features of the Python programming language.
Therefore the code quality is much lower than my "polished" [Project Euler](https://euler.stephan-brumme.com) solutions.


When ?
------

I started my journey in August 2023 and try to solve at least one problem a day.
Problems were chosen more or less at random - without following a certain plan.
Nevertheless, as of October 2023 the following plans are **100%** complete:

- [x] Top Interview 150
- [x] Leetcode 75
- [x] Top SQL 50
- [x] Programming Skills  (only _free_ problems)
- [x] Dynamic Programming (only _free_ problems)
- [x] Binary Search       (only _free_ problems)


And finally ...
---------------

Please don't ask any questions on the Leetcode problems / algorithms, these requests will be ignored.
There are tons of websites and videos out there dedicated to Leetcode solutions.
