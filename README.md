What ?
------

This repository contains my solutions to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems.
All files are code fragments. They need the Leetcode environment for proper includes / imports / namespaces / etc.


Why ?
-----

The main purpose **wasn't** solving these problems but upgrading my Python skills from "beginner" to "intermediate".
There was a warm up with a few problems in C++ and then I switched to Python.
I chose problems more or less at random - without following a certain plan.

The focus **wasn't** on writing clean / readable / compact code but on experimenting with features of the Python programming language.
Therefore the code quality is much lower than my "polished" [Project Euler](https://euler.stephan-brumme.com) solutions.


And finally ...
---------------

Please don't ask any questions on the Leetcode problems / algorithms, these requests will be ignored.
There are tons of websites and videos out there dedicated to Leetcode solutions.
